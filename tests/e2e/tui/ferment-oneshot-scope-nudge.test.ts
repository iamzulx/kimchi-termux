/**
 * E2E TUI test: --ferment-oneshot does not die on a text-only stop during
 * draft scoping.
 *
 * Before the fix, `shouldSuppressHiddenNudge` returned `true` for any
 * `action.kind === "scope"` regardless of continuation policy. In one-shot
 * (automated) mode the reactive continuation nudge is the only thing keeping
 * the session alive when the model emits a text-only stop during draft
 * scoping — suppressing it ended the run with the ferment never scoped. This
 * test reproduces that exact stall and asserts the harness injects a
 * `ferment_continuation_nudge` (visible as the scope action line) and
 * continues into a follow-up turn instead of terminating.
