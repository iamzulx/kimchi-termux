/**
 * Two complementary nudges for Kimi K2.x tool-calling quirks that each
 * leave the agent loop in a stuck-looking state. Both target the same failure
 * class (model said one thing, didn't follow through in the next tool-use
 * step) and are delivered as `followUp` messages from the `turn_end` handler
 * so the agent loop restarts:
 *
 *   1. Continuation nudge — the orchestrator reasons in prose, announces it
 *      will delegate, and ends its turn without emitting the `Agent` tool
 *      call. Mirrors AISI Inspect's `on_continue`.
 *
 *   2. Empty-turn nudge — some Kimi deployments return an empty response
 *      (no text, no tool calls) after receiving tool results from a
 *      tool-call-only turn. `EmptyTurnNudge` tracks whether the previous
 *      turn was tool-call-only so the `turn_end` handler can decide.
 *
 * Both are delivered as custom messages with `display: false` so they
 * never appear in the conversation. Stale nudges (those the model has
 * already acted on) are stripped from the LLM context by
 * `stripStaleNudges` before each call.
 *
 * Both are orchestrator-only concerns — wired in `prompt-enrichment.ts`
 * inside the `if (!subagentMode)` guard.
